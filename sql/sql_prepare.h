/**
  An interface that is used to take an action when
  the locking module notices that a table version has changed
  since the last execution. "Table" here may refer to any kind of
  table -- a base table, a temporary table, a view or an
  information schema table.

  When we open and lock tables for execution of a prepared
  statement, we must verify that they did not change
  since statement prepare. If some table did change, the statement
  parse tree *may* be no longer valid, e.g. in case it contains
  optimizations that depend on table metadata.

  This class provides an interface (a method) that is
  invoked when such a situation takes place.
  The implementation of the method simply reports an error, but
  the exact details depend on the nature of the SQL statement.

  At most 1 instance of this class is active at a time, in which
  case THD::m_reprepare_observer is not NULL.

  @sa check_and_update_table_version() for details of the
  version tracking algorithm 

  @sa Open_tables_state::m_reprepare_observer for the life cycle
  of metadata observers.
